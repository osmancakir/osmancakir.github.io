  <div class="content">
  <p>Happy new year, and welcome to one of my new year&rsquo;s resolutions. This one is for watching films. Since I have found a job, I am slowly starting to feel like I am breathing again. As this feeling grows in me, all my dreams about living a simple, peaceful and at least not an unhappy life are coming back to me.</p>

<p>This year I am going to watch an ambitious number of films and I will try to be as honest as I can to rate and review them. Some of them will be wrong and misjudged because of my ignorance and maybe even my bad taste.</p>

<p>But I want to be really free from any critics view, imdb score etc. It is just going to be how I feel and think about the film.</p>

<ul>
<li>I am not going to praise a film due to its camera, angle etc. innovations for it&rsquo;s time.</li>
<li>I won&rsquo;t be praising a film due to it&rsquo;s historical importance for the film art.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will be only focusing on what impressed me the most in the film;</p>

<ul>
<li>whether I find it is boring or not,</li>
<li>whether it moved me emotionally with it&rsquo;s screenplay,</li>
<li>whether it made me think of something deep enough to have a moment of silence; my life, family, friends, past, future, anything.</li>
<li>Whether it inspired me an idea, feeling, experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hard to explain this. I think the word I am looking for is something like Robert M. Pirsig&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;quality&rdquo; or maybe sincerety, as in the sense of putting honest work and effort to stay true to the idea of the film and managing to be not to be boring at the same time.</p>

<p>&ndash;spoiler alert &ndash; Please read reviews and grading at your own risk. Let&rsquo;s start;</p>

<h6> 1 - Cleo from 5 to 7 - Agnes Varda - 1962 - France - 01.01.2021</h6>

<p><img src="https://osmancakir.io/2021Films/cleofrom5To7.PNG" alt="png" /></p>

<p>Grade : 2 / 5 - a bit boring, slow.</p>

<p>The most beautiful part to me is seeing Paris in the 60s. And that scene with Cleo&rsquo;s friend where she is posing nude for sculptors. The sculptures at the gallery were also looking interesting. It is the french sculptore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Couturier_(sculptor)">Robert Couturier</a>&rsquo;s Atelier. The dialogue for posing nude was impressive.</p>

<p>In general, the dialogues weren&rsquo;t very inspiring or impressive to me.</p>

<h6> 2 - Inside Llewyn Davis - Coen Brothers - 2013 - U.S. - 03.01.2021</h6>

<p><img src="https://osmancakir.io/2021Films/insideLlewynDavis.PNG" alt="png" /></p>

<p>Grade : 3 / 5 - not so boring, okay.</p>

<p>Coen Brothers are known for being one of the most acclaimed independent film makers in U.S. They deserve this title, I give that to them. Their films are different than Hollywood films. The film reminded me another film by them, A Serious Man. What I like about this film that it felt real. We see a man trying to do his own thing, folk music. Trying to make a life with it. Doing the thing he likes. And he struggles. But his struggles are not extraordinary things. They are very very probable struggles. There are not so much heroic things in it. We don&rsquo;t see really bad people around him. We don&rsquo;t see poeple trying to undermine him because they have other agenda, motives, or simply they don&rsquo;t want him to be successful. They are like normal people, normal friends. They might want you to be happy, they might occasionally help you for little things but in reality they do not have so much time for you (they have their own life and problems etc.), not willing to really listen to you and your dreams. And often they give advices that they think the best for you without really empathizing with you.</p>

<p>And we don&rsquo;t see a man &ldquo;who always believed in himself, his music, his talent etc.&rdquo; He gives up. Something gives him a ray of hope again and he try again and fail again. In accordance with this, we don&rsquo;t see a man who we know for sure has great talent from the beginning. He has something, he is a little bit different, unique. He is serious about his music. All these qualities are there but this story is not like a genius&rsquo;s story who is wasted  because of the society that never understood him kind of story.</p>

<h6> 3 - Azizler - Taylan Brothers - 2020 - Turkey - 07.01.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 3 / 5 - not so boring, okay.</p>

<p>Taylan brothers are Turkish Coen Brothers. The reality of some situations can be better visible and tangible (recognizable??) if you tell/show them in a cleverly absurd way. Aziz&rsquo;s girlfriend looping when he wanted to break up. What an amazing image.</p>

<p><img src="https://osmancakir.io/2021Films/azizler.jpg" alt="jpg" /></p>

<h6> 4 - Cinayet Süsü - Ali Atay - 2019 - Turkey - 09.01.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 3.5 / 5 - okay, alright. think it had a good idea.</p>

<p>Serial Killer pretending to be an artist of some sort was well done at true detective series if you watched it. Here is a nice little touch to the very same idea.</p>

<h6> 5 - Chappie - Neill Blomkamp - 2015 - USA - 16.01.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 3 / 5 - okay, alright.</p>

<p>Had fun watching it.</p>

<h6> 6 - jurassic world - Colin Trevorrow - 2015 - USA - 17.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 1 / 5 - complete waste of time.</p>

<p>I was really unhappy, okay? I needed an easy going happy ending film on netflix. Oh Jurassic Park remake, how bad it could be, I told to myself. The only thing I want to remember about this is film that scene with the guy asking to the woman: u raised this giant without any social relationship? The only emotional relationship it has is with this crane giving her food now, well done. so we learn to like, talk, accept, collaborate with each other by being social. By being with others.</p>

<h6> 7 - Wiener-Dog - Todd Solondz - 2016 - USA - 18.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 5 / 5 - a-ma-zing.</p>

<p>The upper-class family, their son and the wiener dog. The whole picture was complete. Well represented. Well said. I felt like, yeah, these are the selfish, annoying, ambitious, jealous, entitled, hard working suckers who win and run the world. I almost fell out of my chair off of laughing when the mother was explaining to her son why should they sterilize the dog. That poor olive skinned, black haired dog-muhammt living in the jungle raping not sterilezed dogs. And then, greta comes in. Oh my. I love wonderfully weird and able to be recklessly themselves people. In real life and also in cinema. Though it surprised me at one place. When she met the former high school bully I thought she was just behaving like she was in high school again, because to me at least there is this strange reminiscence effect that when I meet a person from high school/primary school era of my life, a lacking confidence shitty version of me from that era resurfaces for a couple of minutes like it is still in me. But she wasn&rsquo;t having a remiscence effect. They have become friends. Anyways, a realllyy good film.</p>

<h6> 8 - Hannah Takes The Stairs - Joe Swanberg - 2007 - USA 18.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 3.5 / 5 - so hard to grade this because Greta gerwig heartheartheart.</p>

<p>Joe Swanberg was already there to understand the complicated relationships of man and women back in 2007. I love his work. Especially the netflix production Easy. I can imagine him pitching his film idea like; &ldquo;hey guys, you know, there are thousands of films showing how people are not listening to each other, how they stay seperated and sad and at the same time able to hold grudges for decades. We see this with Bergmans, Spanish dramas and so on. How about if they actually try to communicate? What would it be if people be grown-ups and talk to each other kindly and honestly. How would that work?, my films are going to be about those well educated, kind city people. I will tell their stories.&rdquo; And he is amazing to do this. I can totally relate with his chracters in the films. I learn from them too.</p>

<h6> 9 - Shame - Steve McQueen - 2011 - USA - 19.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 2 / 5 - a bit boring but had some moments.</p>

<p>had its moments. the scene with the sister and telling her that he felt trapped felt real to me. too much music used. I muted most of the scenes with music and it was better actually. good fit for &ldquo;a bit boring&rdquo; category.</p>

<h6> 10 - Olla - Arinae Labed - 2019 - USA - 19.02.20201</h6>

<p>Grade : 2 / 5 - would be boring if it is a long one.</p>

<p>Duration wise, this film could be a good reference point for so many self categorized art-house films. It manages to earn a well deserved grade 2 with it is cinematic message/art etc.</p>

<h6> 11 - Starlet - Sean Baker - 2012 - USA - 19.02.2021 - exited after 40 min.</h6>

<p>Grade : 1 / 5 - boring, exited after 40 min.</p>

<p>After watching Florida Project, my expectations were a bit high. This is why I maybe thought this is a boring film and quit it.</p>

<h6> 12 - Mistress America - Noah Baumbach - 2015 - USA - 20.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 5 / 5 - Greta and Noah Baumbach heart heart heart</p>

<p>A young woman (Tracy) who moved to study literature in NY. Her mother is marrying with someone else soon. And he has a 30 year old daughter (Brooke) living in NY. Living the full life. Doing interesting things, meeting interesting people, living in an interesting appartement and with full of dreams too. She and Tracy meet each other and Tracy is obviously felt attracted to her and her life. She also wrote a story about her. Portraying her life and personality. Describing her as she is irresponsible, being late to grow up. What an amazing angle it was. From the Tracy&rsquo;s perspective it is about being a ruthless observer to be a good writer; selfish, manipulative, player (of her role narrating the story), but from the other side, it is also about knowing/telling the truth for the other. I think I can never forgive the people like Tracy who think they can hold any other agenda other than the relationship. Full honesty and sincerety is what I am looking for.</p>

<p>She being 30 and feeling she is becoming late to grow up mostly because of society&rsquo;s pressure and dictation part was also a great thing about this film. When you are young your wants are also opportunities as you grow older opportunities become less and less and you turn to be a pure want and that is not nice was a really great line. I actually want to watch this part again. Wow I just found it on the first try: at 34:00 it goes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>TRACY: I know what it is to want things.</p></li>

<li><p>BROOKE: No, you don&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t really know what it is to want things until you&rsquo;re at least 30. And then, with each passing year, it gets bigger&hellip; because the want is more and the possibility is less. Like how each passing year of your life seems faster&hellip; because it&rsquo;s a smaller portion of your total life. Like that. But in reverse. Everything becomes pure want.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This film gave me so much courage and fuel to dream / want big things again. I told my roommate, that I will be doing things again. I was really high on inspiration. Thank you Greta, Thank you Noah!</p>

<h6> 13 - Lady Bird - Greta Gerwig - 2017 - USA - 20.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 4.5 / 5 - Was it a good one? yes! can I complain about anything? No!</p>

<h6> 14 - 20th Century Women - Mike Mills - 2016 - USA - 21.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 5 / 5 - a-ma-zing.</p>

<p>omg omg! I needed to look for and find many awesome references and media used in this film</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the books about feminism that greta gave to the kid : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Bodies,_Ourselves">Our Bodies, Ourselves</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisterhood_Is_Powerful">Sisterhood Is Powerful</a> then re-watch and find the passage he read to his mother</p>

<p>01:23:52 - I am gregarious&hellip; Interested in others. and I think intelligent&hellip; All I ask is to get to know people and&hellip; to have them interested in knowing me. I doubt whether I would marry again and live that close to another individual. But I remain invisible. Don&rsquo;t pretend for a minute, as you look at me that I&rsquo;m not as alive as you are. and I do not suffer from the category&hellip; to which you are forcing me. I think stripped down I look more attractive than my ex-husband&hellip; But I am sexually and socially obsolete. And he is not. I have a capacity now for taking people as they are. which I lacked at twenty. I reach orgasm in half the time&hellip; and I know how to please&hellip; Yet I do not even dare show a man that I find him attractive. If I do so, he may react as if I had insulted him. I am supposed to fulfill my small functions and vanish.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/carter-crisis/">crisis of confidence</a> speech by Carter.</p>

<p>01:27:00 - As you know, There is a growing disrespect for government&hellip; The schools, the news media and all the institutions. This is not a message of happiness or reassurance. But it is the truth and it is a warning. It is a crisis of confidence. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of unity and purpose for our nation. Too many of us now, tend to worship self indulgence and consumption. But we&rsquo;ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning. We always believed that we were part of a great movement of humanity itself called democracy, involved in the search for freedom&hellip; We are at a turning point in our history. The path that leads to fragmentation and self-interest down that road lies a mistaken idea of freedom. It is a certain route to failure. Thank you and good night.</p></li>

<li><p>what a nice house it was. I must remind myself again that I always wanted to live in a big appartment with a high ceiling. I must definetely take this dream seriously. After I am debt free again, and after I save a little bit more for the deposit and real estate comission fees, I am gonna start looking for a big room in a big appartment. I can pay a little bit more than I am paying now. That&rsquo;s fine.</p></li>

<li><p>funny lessons on how to date women from Greta :)</p></li>

<li><p>I want to have a t-shirt <strong>ART FAG</strong> printed on it
&gt;A pretentious art student (usually in college) who listens to nothing but obscure indie and art rock bands (besides Death Cab, Radiohead, Interpol, The Strokes, Belle and Sebsastian, and Sonic Youth). They wear black-rimmed square glasses, a track jacket with stripes on the side, tight corduroy pants that are ripped, Chuck Taylors or Vans, man purses (even the girls), and some sort of hair farming technique (on black people, it&rsquo;s an afro with dreads)</p></li>

<li><p>Are you happy? What? you don&rsquo;t ask to a person questions like that! - Why? <strong>Wondering if you are happy is a great shortcut to just being depressed.</strong></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads">Talking Heads</a> band.</p></li>

<li><p>there a few more. but I am finishin my notes here because I will definetely rewatch this film</p></li>

<li><p>I also learned that after wacthing this one that this film is mostly autobiography of Mike Mill. And the other film he made the beginners was also autopbiographical. Which was also a great film.</p></li>
</ul>

<h6> 15 - Little Women - Greta Gerwig - 2019 - USA - 21.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 4 / 5 - Greta Gerwig cann pull it off with big productions too.</p>

<p>Well directed. An heart warming &ldquo;classic&rdquo; story. All the characters are good, kind people. they struggle and overcome their issues.</p>

<h6>16 - The Squid and The Whale - Noah Baumbach - 2015 - 22.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 5 / 5</p>

<ul>
<li>Jesse eisenberg&rsquo;s situation. Talking other people&rsquo;s comments on books as his and singing hey you by roger waters as his song</li>
<li>&ldquo;I think, I could do better.&rdquo; (meaning women) - Better in what sense?</li>

<li><p><strong>Philistine people</strong>.
&gt;If you call someone a philistine, you mean that they do not care about or understand good art, music, or literature, and do not think that they are important.</p></li>

<li><p>How competitive the father is. And how does he become a jerk when he starts to lose. Ah this is soo real. There are real jerks in this life.</p></li>
</ul>

<h6>17 - The Meyerowitz Stories - Noah Baumbach - USA - 2017 - 22.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 1 / 5 - found boring.</p>

<p>Maybe it was funny and I wasn&rsquo;t in my mood for this one.</p>

<h6>18 - Greenberg - Noah Baumbach - USA - 2010 -  23.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 5 / 5</p>

<p>omg omg!</p>

<ul>
<li>Life is wasted on people</li>
<li>It is huge to finally embrace the life you never planned on</li>
</ul>

<p>Our guy, Greenberg, used to make music and become almost famous. He refused a record deal thinking it will not be the only one and unfortunately it was and now he is a carpenter. He is depressed and visiting his brother and trying to do nothing for a while.</p>

<p>These two sentences are actually revealing so much comfort and relief and so well explained in this film, it feels like a hug.</p>

<h6>19 - While We're Young - Noah Baumbach - USA - 2014 - 23.02.2021</h6>

<p>Grade : 5 - 5 - a-ma-zing</p>

<p>omg there are so many things to talk about this film.</p>

<p>First lets talk about adam driver in this film. he is a selfish manipulative dishonest (trying to look/behave/seem like someone &ldquo;cooler&rdquo; than himself) bastard. And Noah sees this as it is about being young? I mean What? How? Why? Is it, really is it? This is a pure fucked up evil shit kind of behaviour. Albeit I am happy that Noah is able to show a solid example of this kind of people, I am awfully disappointed that he thinks that this is actually an okay behaviour, somewhat a trait of being young.</p>

<p>There are billions of people believing the idea of being honest, kind and hard-working pays off. These people can not even ask a basic favor from others yet being so manipulative and dishonest and so eager to use others.</p>

<p>These people grow up thinking that they need to earn anything to deserve in life, yet thinking that they are entitled to anything. I am so angry and sad for these people. I thought this film is about this. Finally, I thought, someone saw the fuckers around these people and able to point the finger. So they can not sneak around and steal the life, talent, warmth and love among us, exploit the sharing and trust among us.</p>

<p>oh god! please! someone! figure out who are the yavsak ones any more!</p>

<p>The fathers words about success is probably where he finds the connection with being young and being an awful person is actually related.</p>

<p>Father: You know, looking back on my career, I wonder, how did I accomplish so much? If I&rsquo;m honest with myself, it sometimes took being a selfish prick at the expense of you and your mother. Of course, I don&rsquo;t say that. I say talent, work, luck. Your husband doesn&rsquo;t realize what it takes, he&hellip; He still believes the speeches.</p>

<p>Cornelia : You know, when I first started dating him,
he reminded me so much of you.</p>

<p>Father: He wants what I have, but he&rsquo;s not merciless enough to get it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I need to rewatch and take note of that power elite pitch. It was a good one to think about.</p>

<p>Josh: is our guy who wants to make a documentary about power elite
SP: Studio producer guy.</p>

<p>Josh is making a pitch to get funding for his film.</p>

<ul>
<li>Josh: Do you know the percentage of African-American adult males currently in jail?</li>
<li>SP:  I don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Josh: Take a guess.</li>
<li>SP:  Like 60%?</li>
<li>Josh: Jesus, no. It&rsquo;s over 9%. That&rsquo;s nearly 1-in-10 African-American adult males, nearly a million and a half.</li>
<li>SP:  A million and a half is a lot.</li>
<li>Josh: It&rsquo;s insane, but people don&rsquo;t realize this. They think because we have a black president&hellip;</li>
<li>SP:  So this is about prison. Like a black <i>Shawshank.</i> But real.</li>
<li>No, not&hellip; No. There&rsquo;s a section, an entr&rsquo;acte really, about the function of race in the prison industrial complex, but the film is really about how power works in America. Do you know the historian Ira Mandelstam?</li>
<li>SP:  Yeah.</li>
<li>Josh: Really?</li>
<li>SP:  No.</li>
<li>Josh: Well, we have over 100 hours of interviews with him.</li>
<li>SP:  The movie&rsquo;s 100 hours?</li>
<li>Josh: No, we&rsquo;ll cut it.</li>
<li>SP:  Phew!</li>
<li>Josh: Now, this guy, he&rsquo;s&hellip; He isn&rsquo;t particularly charismatic, he&rsquo;s kind of anti-social, maybe Asperger&rsquo;s, but not interesting Asperger&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s kind of boring, even. But he&rsquo;s a charismatic thinker.</li>
<li>SP:  How do you show what he thinks? Cartoons?</li>
<li>Josh: No, not cartoons. He says it.</li>
<li>SP:  But he&rsquo;s boring.</li>
<li>Josh: Well, yes. But as with many boring things, the longer you watch it, it takes on a different dimension. It&rsquo;s really a very simple idea. The three sections correspond with the three nodes of what Mills called the power elite. The political, military and economic. But, and this is key,
each part has to interconnect to show how none of the three nodes functions without the other. It&rsquo;s a linear film, of course, but I imagine it as kind of a hypertext.</li>
<li>SP:  So, what&rsquo;s it about?</li>
<li>Josh: To be clear, the film is really about the working class, and I can&rsquo;t speak on behalf of the working class. I can&rsquo;t make their film, of course. But they have to be felt as the impossible subject of the text. If that makes sense. But it isn&rsquo;t even really about the power structure but about what it means to make a film about it. It&rsquo;s about the very possibility of making this film. It&rsquo;s really about America.</li>
